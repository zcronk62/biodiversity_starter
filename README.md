# Biodiversity In National Parks Porfolio Project

## Introduction

The purpose of this project will be to showcase data wrangling and data tidy skills acquired through the Data Scientist Career Path from Codecademy. The project consists of the following files:

- `biodiversity.ipynb`: a Jupyter Notebook file containing the analyses.
- `observations.csv`: a `.csv` file containing the observational data for the national parks.
- `species_info.csv`: a `.csv` file containing the species information for each of the unique observed organisms in `ovservations.csv`.

## Technology

To perform the analyses, this porject will use Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook. Data wrangling and tidying will be completed using the `pandas` library. Visualization will be perfomred using the `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn` libraries.

## Project Goals

1. Inspect and clean each dataset.
2. Inspect the observation distributions.
3. Inspect the distribution of conservation statuses for each species.
4. Combine the two `.csv` files into a master DataFrame object.
5. Analyze and interpret how the frequency with which a species is obbserved is related to species category and/or conservation status.
